# Weather Prediction with Machine Learning

This project uses a linear regression model to predict temperature based on weather features like humidity, pressure, and wind speed.

## 📁 Files
- `weather_prediction.py`: Python notebook with all code and output
- `weather.csv`: Dataset
- `plot.png`: Visual of actual vs predicted temperatures

## 🧠 Skills Used
- Data cleaning (pandas)
- Regression modeling (scikit-learn)
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Model evaluation (R² score)

## 🚀 Try it Yourself
Open the notebook in Visual Studio or Google Colab and run all cells.
